## Hi there 👋
I am currently engaged in the research of intelligent information processing, target recognition and tracking. If you are seeking any form of **academic cooperation**, please feel free to email me at [liqiusheng@gnnu.edu.cn](mailto:liqiusheng@gnnu.edu.cn). I mainly recruit and cultivate postgraduates who are interested in studying the related fields of intelligent information processing and are willing to engage in research, development, production or application in this field！

I earned my B.Eng. in Telecommunication Engineering from [Shanghai Railway University](https://baike.sogou.com/v7682323.htm) (上海铁道大学) (now integrated into [Tongji University](https://www.tongji.edu.cn/index.htm) (同济大学)), followed by an M.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering from [Beihang University](https://www.buaa.edu.cn/) (北京航空航天大学). I completed my Ph.D. under the supervision of [Prof. Xie Weixin](https://iip.szu.edu.cn/yjdw1/xieweixin.htm) at the School of Information Engineering, [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/) (深圳大学).

My research interests include algorithm innovation and system application in radar signal processing, computer vision, physiological signal processing (eeg/ecg) and text emotion calculation. I have published more than 20 papers in SCI or EI journals as the first author or corresponding author. My papers have been downloaded [more than 17,000 times](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/author/detail?v=Ut-mckhA-Rs_Qzvuh-2f7oNj0ld9KBEU_NXqQgQ1UXF3kOoEuVjpDthITU3BpcDWoORD3PBhuhg6K8Y98ANvOlCc6DwahWKKsCZWJawdo-cEpGVTNCEUcapsujzehlq4&uniplatform=NZKPT&language=CHS) on CNKI.
